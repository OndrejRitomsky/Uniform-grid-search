A* on uniform cost 4way grid graph  
With:  
HashSet for unsigned integers (UIntSet)  
MinPriorityQueue with templated values and unsigned int weights  
Simple tests for set and queue  
Malloc allocator wrapped to count allocations and thread safety  
  
Simple bit array functions  
Grid drawing to console  
Spinlock  
Block profiling in cycles  
  
	
One day maybe more graph searches
